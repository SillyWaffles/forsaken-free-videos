# forsaken-free-videos
This tutorial will guide you through adding a high-performance, free video intro (or outro) to any skin in Forsaken. This system replaces Roblox's deprecated VideoFrame by using a "sprite sheet" method, which converts your video into a series of images. This costs 0 Robux and includes perfectly synced audio.
